Genocide/Neutral Glitchless

<img src='./Images/UTSRGuidesHeader.png'></img>

## Introduction

The Neutral Glitchless category is very similar to the Genocide category. The first half of the run focuses on optimally killing all the monsters necessary for every area with few variations from the Genocide category. Once you reach Hotland, the categories start to diverge, as Neutral Glitchless heads to Asgore right away.

***Timing starts on "YES" on name confirmation.***

## Ruins

> Kills Required: 20

### Handholding

After hitting “Yes” at the name selection, you should hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>, so you can start moving as soon as possible.

Walk down the hallway to the right. Enter the doorway. Walk up towards Flowey and begin his dialogue. Mash the text and begin the battle.

Mash away the text as soon as Flowey talks to you. After Flowey winks, you won't be able to mash the text away. Instead, repeatedly press <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>, so you will end the text as soon as it reaches the end.

After Flowey winks, you will want to position yourself a little bit to the right of the top left corner. Being here will ensure that you get hit by the ~~bullets~~ friendliness pellets as soon as possible.

After being hit by the friendliness pellets, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>◀ Left</kbd>. Moving to the bottom left corner and holding down the <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> arrow keys will make the circle attack hit you quicker than normal.

After being hit, prepare your mashing once again. Once Toriel appears, mash away her text.

You can hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> while mashing the text to move upwards as soon as you are able to. After mashing away Toriel's text, follow her upwards into the next room.

In the first room, walk up the staircase around the save point and into the door. Don't bother saving, it just wastes time. In the next room, mash away Toriel's text and hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>. You don't need to move to enter the door.

This next room is a bit hard to do optimally. Hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> as you mash Toriel's text. When you get past the bridge, start wall humping and press <kbd>Z</kbd> when you pass the switch. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> until Toriel walks out of the way, and then do the same thing for the 2nd switch. After hitting the 2nd switch, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>-<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and mash away Toriel's text.

In the next room, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>-<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> while mashing away Toriel's text and then interact with the dummy. Go to ACT and select “Talk” to spare the dummy.

In the next room, mash away Toriel's text and follow her. You will encounter a Froggit. Hit the Froggit with a critical attack for 20 or more damage to increase your LV to 2; if you hit the Froggit for 19 or less, it's a reset. Mash away her text and watch the hand-hold cutscene. Take a sip of water, staying hydrated is important.

This next room is the hardest room in the game. Walk right and mash away Toriel's text.

### First Half Ruins

Possible Random Encounters:

- Froggit: 50%
- Whimsun:  50%

In the first room with the leaves, you will get a phone call at the very beginning. Don't save at the save point, go down & right towards the next room. Begin wall humping right next to the exit to get an encounter.

- If you get a Whimsun, FIGHT it and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Any hit will kill it immediately.
- If you get a Froggit, land one accurate hit on it. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> when it begins to attack. If you get the frog attack, you will run into the frog and end the turn early. If you get the flies attack, simply dodge the flies. After enduring the attack, finish it off with a semi-accurate hit.
  - You can predict the Froggit's attack based on what it says. “Meow” and “Hop Hop” = Flies attack, “Ribbit” = Frog attack, “Croak” = 50% chance for either attack. Overall, you have a ~40% chance to get a Frog Attack.

After ending the encounter, go into the next room and begin Wall Humping immediately; grind out another encounter. Alternate between these two rooms & grind encounters until you have 11 kills total.

After grinding out 11 kills, go to the 2nd room with the cracked floor, fall into the pit, and head through the door on the right. Grind out one more encounter for a total of 12 kills before going to the next room.

In the room with the single rock, you will receive two phone calls at the beginning. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> & <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> into the rock to push it onto the switch. You will receive a third phone call, then grind out another encounter for a total of 13 kills. Exit the room.

You can skip the third phone call by reading the sign along the top wall before pushing the rock. This saves a small amount of time.

In the next room with the pit puzzle, simply navigate through the pit traps. If you don't know the pattern, fall through the floor and observe the path through the leaves. Be careful not to fall in this room because it wastes a big chunk of time. Don't grind for an encounter in this room, proceed to the next room.

### Second Half Ruins

Possible Random Encounters:

- Froggit/Whimsun: 25%
- Moldsmal x3: 25%
- Single Moldsmal: 25%
- Froggit x2: 15%
- Moldsmal x2: 10%

In the room with the three rocks, position yourself to the right of the bottom rock. Talk to the rock three times until it reaches the end and lowers the spikes. Walk to the right until the spikes rise again, turn around, and talk to the rock for a fourth time to lower the spikes permanently. Grind for an encounter. After ending the encounter, enter into the cheese room and walk back into the Three Rock room.

The best encounter you can get in this room is a Froggit/Whimsun. Kill the Whimsun first so you can get the frog attacks with the Froggit.

You will get encounters with varying amounts of Moldsmals. FIGHT the moldsmals the same way you would fight a Froggit. A single Moldsmal is the worst encounter you can get in this room.

You may also encounter two Froggits. Kill one of them first so you can get frog attacks from the other.

Grind encounters until you reach 20 kills. If you are in an encounter and get your 20th kill, flee from the remaining monsters. Exit into the cheese room.

### Leaving the Ruins

Don't save in the cheese room, just head right into the exit. If you're bored, you can wall hump along the wall and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> as you pass the mouse hole.

If you counted correctly and are at 20 kills, Napstablook will disappear as you enter the room. Walk straight and take the right exit. There will be a spiderweb at the top of the room, interact with it and purchase a single spider donut. **DO NOT EAT THE SPIDER DONUT! YOU NEED IT TO SKIP MUFFET!**

Return to the room where Napstablook was and take the exit upwards.

Go right in the hallway after Napstablook. You will get what seems to be an encounter. However, there will be no monsters and the text will simply read, “But nobody came...”. This is your confirmation that you are on the Genocide route. Continue heading right, get a phone call from Toriel, and exit the room.

In the room with six pit traps, go the top-middle one. Fall into the trap and hit the switch at the bottom. Go through the door to return to the main room and exit to the right.

In the first switch room, go to the exit at the bottom right.

In the second switch room, go to the right of the switch behind the first pillar and activate it. Head to the exit at the bottom-left.

In the third switch room, activate the switch behind the pillar at the end of the room. Exit the room upwards.

In the fourth switch room, activate the switch behind the top-left pillar. Then head right towards the exit.

In the next room, go upwards at the three-way intersection. Don't bother grabbing the toy knife.

In the next room, mash Toriel's text and enter her house. Don't save because it's slow.

Mash Toriel's text when you enter the house and then head right to follow her into the hallway. Mash her text until Toriel leaves. Head left and exit back into the foyer.

If you so choose, you can go inside the room to sleep and grab the pie. The pie is a full heal, however grabbing it wastes a moderate amount of time. And there are better healing items available to you later in the game. The pie also lowers Asgore's attack; however, you will be at such a high LV in Neutral Glitchless that Asgore shouldn't give you much trouble.

After leaving the hallway, head left through the foyer and into the living room. Talk with Toriel. When she tells you about a snail fact, choose the second option (how to leave the ruins). If you miss this option, talk to her again and choose the second option.

Follow Toriel downstairs and mash her text when she stops you. When you reach the end of the hallway, start the battle with Toriel.

When Toriel's battle begins, Mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> to FIGHT & hit her as soon as possible. Any attack will one-shot her. Continue mashing <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> to finish her text. After her heart breaks, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> & exit the hallway. Continue holding <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> through the next room. Walk up to Flowey.

Mash Flowey's text, then enter the door behind him to leave the ruins.

## Snowdin

> Kills Required: 16

### Dogs & Puzzles & Skeletons

Walk right down the long hallway. Mash Sans' text when you meet him. After meeting Sans, you will be put in another cutscene with Papyrus and Sans. Mash through the text and head right. Sans will talk to you right before exiting the room, mash through this as well.

In the next room, interact with the savepoint if you need health. Go to the chest and take out the Tough Glove & equip it. Head right and encounter a Snowdrake. Kill the Snowdrake with a very accurate hit (green) followed by an inaccurate hit (red); then exit to the right.

In the next room, mash through the cutscene and then proceed right down the path. There is a 10% chance you'll get a phone call near the middle of the room. Begin mashing beforehand in case you do get the phone call. Getting the call is a small time loss. You should encounter an Icecap before reaching the end of the room. Kill the Icecap with an accurate hit and then exit right.

Head right in Doggo's room until Doggo appears from his house. Mash the text and begin the fight.

FIGHT Doggo and hit him with a very accurate hit. Doggo will use a slow sword attack that requires you to be completely still to dodge. You can speed up the attack by running into the sword and purposely taking damage. FIGHT Doggo again and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd> when hitting him. Your accuracy does not matter.

**DOGGO DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE KILL COUNT.**

After killing Doggo, exit right.

In the room with the Frozen Pond, don't slide on the ice (sliding on the ice will not progress the step counter). Walk below the ice to get the steps in. Once you reach the end of the ice pond room, grind out an encounter (it should take only a little bit of time). You will encounter the lesser dog. On the first turn, go to ACT and select Pet (alternatively, you can go to ITEM and use the stick). Endure Lesser Dog's attack and then FIGHT on the 2nd turn. You will one-shot them regardless of accuracy. Unlike the other royal guard dogs, **Lesser Dog counts towards the kill count.** After killing Lesser Dog, exit to the right.

If you need some healing items, you can choose to go above the Ice Pond and grab the Snowman Pieces. They heal 45 HP each and are a nice safety heal for Asgore/Undyne. If you choose to go for the Snowman Pieces, grind for Lesser Dog against the trees before going into the next room to grab them. Then, after going back into the Ice Pond room, grind for an extra encounter before exiting the Ice Pond room.

In Papyrus' electric maze room, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and mash all the text. Once the cutscene is over, head right to exit.

In the next room, cross the bridge, head down & right, squeeze between the tree and the cliff, and walk past the snowdecahedron. DON'T GET STUCK ON THE SNOWDECAHEDRON.

In the cold spaghetti room, don't get distracted by the spaghetti and don't save. Exit right.

In the Snow Puzzle room, go down and right to the bridge. Grind an encounter on the bridge. Don't walk too far and trigger the cutscene. Kill whatever you encounter except Jerry. If you encounter Jerry, spare him immediately. This does not end the Genocide route. 

After finishing an encounter, go right to encounter Dogamy & Dogaressa. Mash through the Dog Lovers text and begin the battle. Once the battle begins, select FIGHT and target Dogaressa.

It will take a hit in the green, a hit in the yellow, and a hit in the red of the bar to kill Dogaressa. Once Dogaressa is dead, Dogamy will take one accurate hit to kill. FIGHT Dogamy and execute him.

**DOGAMY & DOGARESSA DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE KILL COUNT.**

After the battle, proceed downwards to the next room.

In the first XO puzzle room, go right and exit right.

In the second XO puzzle room, go right and exit right once more.

In the Color Tile puzzle room, go right and then mash through the cutscene. Exit right.

In the Ice puzzle room, don't worry about touching the X's. Just go straight to the switch and across the bridge. Enter the next room on the right.

Walk to the right and go to the snow poff blocking the exit to the room. Try to not get caught on any other snow poffs on the way there. Watch the cutscene and begin the battle with Greater Dog. You will need 2 accurate hits and one inaccurate hit to kill Greater Dog.

Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> for all of Greater Dog's attacks. If you get an attack with a sleeping dog at the bottom of the frame, run into the dog to end the attack early. If you get a spear attack, dodge the spear. The sleeping dog attack is around 5 seconds faster.

**GREATER DOG DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE KILL COUNT.**

After killing Greater Dog, walk right and exit the room.

### Snowdin Grind & Papyrus Fight

Possible Random Encounters:

- Icecap & Jerry: 56.67%
- Icecap, Chilldrake, & Jerry: 43.33%

In the Gauntlet of Terror room walk across the bridge and trigger the last cutscene of the Forest. Mash through the cutscene, hold <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> as the screen slides back to you, and leave out the door on the left side of the room to reset the room.

Immediately walk back into the Gauntlet of Terror Room and start grinding for encounters. Depending on the encounter you got before the Dog Lovers, you should be at 4 or 5 kills (up to 6 or 7 if you went for the Snowman Pieces). After each encounter, leave and reenter Snowdin out the left door and grind again. Repeat until you have 13 or 14 kills.

Once you have 13 or more kills, leave and reenter, then cross over to the right side of the room and grind out another encounter. If you get lucky, this will be the final encounter and you can immediately leave and proceed to the Papyrus fight. If you get unlucky, you will need to get one more encounter. Do this by leaving and re-entering out the right side of the room, then grinding the final encounter.

When you get a Triple encounter, FIGHT the Icecap first. Then, after Chilldrake's attack, menu down to FIGHT Chilldrake. Accidentally fighting Jerry wastes a turn.

You can dodge Chilldrake's spinning blades attack by sitting in the bottom-left corner of the frame. Try not to get hit on the way to the corner.

Spare Jerry unless killing Jerry brings your kill count to 16. Jerry takes a long time to kill, but killing Jerry is faster than grinding for an encounter at 15 kills.

Optimal RNG is getting the Icecap/Jerry encounter up until 10-12 kills. After that, it is optimal to get the Triple encounter.

After getting the necessary kills, head into Snowdin. Walk right, past the shop and the inn. Don't use the save point or the box. Use the igloo to get to the other side of town faster. After leaving the igloo, exit through the right side of town.

Walk down the hallway. Once the silhouettes of both Frisk and Papyrus appear, Papyrus will begin to talk. Mash all the text and begin the battle.

Immediately FIGHT Papyrus and hit him. Any hit will kill him. After hitting Papyrus, wait for him to die. When you regain movement, walk right and enter Waterfall.

## Waterfall

> Kills Required: 18

### Spears & Glad Dummy

Keep walking right. Don't save.

In the Waterfall room, walk straight and exit right.

If you need some extra protection, there's a hidden entrance in the middle of the waterfall. Inside the waterfall, you will find the Tutu. The Tutu is a nice boost in defense and lessens the damage you will take. However, grabbing the Tutu wastes time and reduces your chances of fleeing successfully. Due to this, it is advised to hold off on equipping the Tutu for now.

Continue walking right, wait through the cutscene and exit to the right after mashing Monster Kid's text.

In the first flower bridge room, just head right. The flower bridge will already be constructed for you.

In the second flower bridge room, you will get a scripted encounter with Aaron before crossing the bridge. FLEE from Aaron as soon as the encounter begins. Cross the bridge, head up, cross over the river on the flower bridge, and head through the doorway at the top.

In the telescope puzzle room, skip the telescope and head upwards towards the secret exit. You will get a scripted encounter with Woshua. FIGHT Woshua and dispatch them with a green hit followed by a red hit. Exit through the doorway at the top of the screen.

In the Bridge room, head right and ride the wooden platform across the water. Exit right.

In the long bridge room, Undyne will appear and begin to throw spears at you as you navigate to the next room. You need to minimize the amount of times you get hit by the spears & to minimize the time you spend stopping to avoid them.

You can manipulate the angle at which the spears are thrown based on your position on the walkway. This can help you dodge, but keep in mind that Undyne's spears have a bit of RNG involved with them. You still need to pay attention to the spears direction even if you've angled them favorably.
Frisk's hitbox is weird; they can get hit slightly below their feet, and the majority of their head doesn't really seem to have a hitbox.
In the second room of the chase, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> to avoid the spears. A cutscene will play when you've reached the end of the chase. Hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> to move as soon as the cutscene ends. After exiting the patch of grass, Monster Kid will appear and talk to you. Mash their text and then exit the room through the right.

Don't bother saving in the crystallized cheese room unless you are in need of health.

In the next room, go right and go down the bridge. Exit downwards.

In the next room with the assorted bridges and talking flowers, go to the right at the turn and head downwards. Turn left onto the bridge heading left. Before entering into the room on the left, grind out an encounter. You will get an encounter of two scripted Moldsmals. FIGHT both of them; they both require one hit in the green to kill.

After the encounter, exit left. Interact with the Ballet Shoes hidden in the center of the grass and pick them up. Equip the Ballet Shoes. After doing so, go back right and exit to the right.

If you are having a hard time managing your health through enemy encounters, this makes for an opportune time to equip the Tutu as well. If you're only using the Tutu for Undyne, wait until just before her battle.
Go down and right once returning to the room. After reaching a turn that leads upward, you will get one of four encounters:

- Two Moldsmals. This is the optimal RNG and you have a 26.67% chance of getting this encounter. Both require a single, fairly accurate hit to kill.
- Woshua, Aaron. You have a 26.67% chance of getting this encounter. Kill the Woshua first by getting a very accurate hit (it doesn't need to be perfect, but should be pretty close). Then, endure Aaron's attack. Then, kill the Aaron using one of the following methods:
  - Hit Aaron with a very accurate hit followed by a semi-accurate hit.
  - Alternatively, if you are confident in your ability with the Ballet Shoes, you can ACT & select FLEX. Then get a very accurate hit to dispatch them on the next turn. This is slightly faster than attacking twice.
- Woshua. You have a 26.67% chance of getting this encounter as well. Dispatch the Woshua by getting a very accurate hit.
- Aaron. This is the worst RNG and thankfully you have only a 20% chance of getting this one. Dispatch him in the same manner as described above.

After killing your encounter, continue upwards and exit through the exit at the top.

In the Onion-san room, you won't encounter Onion-san. Just head right and exit into the next room.

The next room is the Shyren room. You will encounter Shyren right after moving up or down to navigate the square in the room. Once you encounter Shyren, FIGHT her and land a good, accurate hit to kill her in one attack. After killing Shyren, go right into the next room.

Walk right in the statue room and go to the next room.

Don't grab an Umbrella. Just walk right and exit into the next room.

In the first rainy hallway room, walk against the top wall while heading right. Mash Monster kid's text and continue heading right until the hallway turns and exit downwards.

In the second rainy hallway room, continue heading downwards and mash Monster Kid's text when they talk to you. Head right at the turn, mash Monster Kid's text again, and exit through the right.

In the room with the castle in the background, Wall Hump while moving right to gain a big speed boost. Exit through the right.

In the next room with the ledge, walk to the right and talk to Monster Kid. Mash their text and wait for them to tell you to climb onto their shoulders. While you wait for Monster Kid to let you climb up, you can drop the stick here and lose no time. Dropping the stick isn't necessary and is a community meme (but you will look super cool doing it). Mash their text once again and climb onto their shoulders to get onto the top of the ledge. Mash their text, head right and exit right.

Don't save in the next room. Keep walking right.

Continue walking right until you walk into the cutscene trigger. After the cutscene ends, complete the maze and go to the long bridge room.

The spears in the chase are fairly RNG-dependent, but you can easily manipulate where they appear. The game will try to predict where you will move and place the spears, however it won't account for if you're moving into a wall or anything. So move against a wall and hold the directional key to walk into the wall while still progressing. Once the spear placement has been chosen and they begin to appear, simply move off the wall and out of the way.

In the long bridge room after the chase, head right until the third set of spears fades away, turn around, and head left until you trigger the cutscene.

After falling from the bridge, you will get a short cutscene with unskippable text. Just mash <kbd>Z</kbd> & <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

After waking up on the pile of golden flowers, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and exit right. In the room with the save, don't bother saving, keep going right.

Walk into the Glad Dummy room and walk upwards. You can stop by the orange cooler and get some astronaut food if you feel like you will need some healing items for Undyne (be aware that grabbing heals will waste time).

Walk into the Glad Dummy cutscene. Mash the text and begin the battle.

Once the battle begins, FIGHT them and land a semi-accurate hit on Glad Dummy to kill them. Depending on the encounter you got after grabbing the Ballet Shoes, you should now be at 6 or 7 kills. After the battle ends, exit upwards into the main hub room.

In the main hub room, walk right and exit right into Gerson's shop hallway.

In Gerson's shop hallway, walk right, go past the shop (unless you really need to buy safety items for Undyne), and exit right into the double waterfall hallway.

### Waterfall Grind & Undyne the Undying

Possible Random Encounters:

- Woshua, Moldbygg: 40%
- Woshua, Aaron: 33.33%
- Temmie: 26.67%

In the double waterfall hallway, walk right. You will encounter a Temmie in the room without having to grind. FIGHT the Temmie and kill her with a hit of any accuracy. After the encounter, approach the exit at the right. Before going forward into the next room, grind out an encounter with a scripted Moldsmal & Moldbygg. FIGHT & kill both of them. The Moldsmal should be fairly easy to kill in one turn, while the Moldbygg will require a fairly accurate hit to dispatch in one attack. After ending the encounter, exit into the Mushroom puzzle room on your right and grind out a scripted Woshua & Aaron encounter. FIGHT and kill them in the same manner described previously (after picking up the Ballet Shoes). After getting these kills, you should be at 11-12 kills. Transition back into the double waterfall room and grind for another encounter. Repeat this process until you have reached 14 or 15 kills. If you reach 14-15 kills in the mushroom puzzle room, quickly transition back into the double waterfall hallway and back out before continuing forward.

Moldbygg has the slowest attack in Waterfall. If you get the Moldbygg/Woshua encounter, be sure to menu down and attack the Moldbygg first for a little time save.
In the mushroom puzzle room, you don't actually need to light up the mushrooms to walk through the room. Look at the image below to see the path you will need to take. Grind out an encounter just before heading into the Lantern Room.

<img src='./Images/MushroomMaze.png' alt="Mushroom maze solution" title="Mushroom maze solution"></img>

In the lantern room, interact with the lamps as you pass them so you can see where you're going. You want to get the remaining kills in this room. You should be able to get an encounter before reaching the end of the room. If not, grind for an encounter before exiting into the next room. If you are not at 18 kills after this encounter, quickly enter and exit the next room and grind for another encounter. **DO NOT CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT ROOM UNTIL YOU HAVE 18 KILLS!** Once you have 18 kills total, exit into the “Behind You” flower room on the right at the end of the path.

In the “Behind you” flower room, hold <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> when entering the room to put yourself against the wall. After putting yourself against the wall, just hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and mash. You want to talk to the “Behind you” flower as soon as possible and mash away the text. Mash all the text for the cutscene. After the cutscene is over, go left and head upwards onto the new path.

In the Flower hallway, save if you feel like there will be a chance of you dying. Go right into the Monster Kid bridge room once you are ready. If you haven't reached the kill requirement for Waterfall, “Strongly felt [X] left, Shouldn't proceed yet” will appear in red text. If this happens, you have miscounted and need to return to the lantern room and grind an encounter(s) until you've reached the kill requirement.

In the Monster Kid Bridge room, go right and hit the trigger for the cutscene. Mash all the text. Once the battle begins, FIGHT and hit Monster Kid as soon as possible (accuracy does not matter). Mash the battle cutscene and your battle with Undyne the Undying begins.

Undyne the Undying is the hardest enemy in the Genocide speedrun for two reasons.

1. You are required to land perfect hits with the Ballet Shoes in order to get the Undyne Quick Kill. By averaging around 1650 damage throughout the entire battle, you can skip one of Undyne's longer attack phases. You can afford to miss 12 perfect hits before you are unable to get the quick kill. The non-perfect hits also need to be very accurate hits. Healing will cause you to not be able to get the quick kill.
2. Getting hit actually causes the attacks to slow down. This means Undyne's battle is the only fight in the game where a no-hit saves time. Avoid getting hit as much as possible.

A lot of practice is recommended, as beating Undyne the Undying perfectly is very difficult.

For the entirety of the fight, you should just be FIGHTing Undyne and trying to land perfect hits. You can heal, just be aware that healing will waste a considerable amount of time.

Undyne the Undying's attacks have very little RNG in them. You will learn her attack patterns with practice.

After defeating Undyne the Undying, mash her death cutscene. Proceed to the right. Once you reach the Arena room, go into the rock structure at the top of the room. Walk up in the first hallway, walk right in the 2nd hallway, and continue walking right across the Hotland bridge & water cooler room. Continue to head right to enter into Hotland.

## Hotland

> This is where you abort the Genocide route.

### The beginning of Hotland

Don't bother using the save point unless you're in desperate need of heals. Walk right and enter the lab. If you need a healing item, you can pick up the Instant Noodles from the refrigerator. Mash through the cutscene, then exit the lab to the right afterwards.

In the hallway after the lab, go right and go up at the turn. Exit through the exit at the top.

In the treadmill hallway room, take the left path. You will encounter Vulkin in the middle-ish of the room. FLEE from Vulkin. Go up after the encounter and exit through the top exit.

In the first room with the set of vents, head to the bottom right of the room to grab the Burnt Pan (unless you'd rather use the Empty Gun). Somewhere in the process of this you will encounter Tsunderplane. FLEE from Tsunderplane. After you grab the Burnt Pan, exit the main vent room through the top exit.

In the laser hallway, the lasers should be disabled. Simply walk right through the hallway and exit right.

In the next room, go right and go up at the turn. Use the vent when it faces upwards. Enter the doorway at the top of the room.

### Royal Guards

In the next room you will encounter the royal guards. Mash their text and begin the battle. FIGHT one of them and land fairly accurate hits to one-hit kill them. Endure an attack. FIGHT and kill the other one with a fairly accurate hit.

After killing the Royal Guards, ride the vents and exit through the right.

In the next few rooms just hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>. Once you arrive at the elevator, interact with the door and go inside. Interact with the elevator interface and go to left floor 3.

In the room you arrive at, go right. In the next room, go right again and exit right.

Once you arrive at the room with the vents, ride the vents and go to the right. Once you arrive at the long platform at the right of the room, go right and go up at the turn. Go inside the doorway at the end of the platform. 

Continue into the doorway to the right to enter Muffet's lair.

### Muffet

Go right and dodge the spider webs. Mash the text. Walk onto the unavoidable spider webs. Keep mashing text. When you reach the center of the web (where you're prevented from moving), don't press any arrow keys as this will cause Muffet to appear later. Just hold still and wait.

Once Muffet appears, mash her text and begin the battle.

Eat the spider donut during the fight and spare Muffet. After the battle is over, go right and exit right.

Once you exit the spider lair, go right in the room with the poster. In the next room, go right once again. In the room with the stairs at the top of the room, go onto the stairs and exit through the top.

In the Hotel entrance room, if you got the Burnt Pan, walk to the big doors and enter the hotel.

If you prefer to use the Empty Gun instead of the Burnt Pan, go right to the alleyway and go into the alleyway. Go into the alleyway shop. Steal the Cowboy Hat and the Empty Gun from the shop. Leave the shop. Equip the Cowboy Hat and the Empty Gun (note: Like the Tutu, equipping the Cowboy Hat will make it less likely to successfully FLEE from an encounter). Go down the alleyway, go left and enter the doors of the hotel.

Inside the Hotel, go up and left around the fountain. Exit through the exit at the top of the room. If you *really* need heals for Asgore, grab some at Burgerpants' shop before leaving the hotel.

In the Core transition room, go up and enter the Core.

## Core

> A very intense boss fight and a very long elevator ride.

Enter the first elevator in Core, and then enter Mettaton's boss room.

### Mettaton NEO

Once you enter the room, walk up and trigger the cutscene with Mettaton (make sure you have the Ballet Shoes equipped). Once the battle begins, FIGHT and hit Mettaton as soon as possible. Your accuracy doesn't matter. Mash the text after hitting Mettaton. After the battle, head up and enter the doorway at the top of the room.

In the long hallway, go up and go right at the turn. Keep going right until you reach the elevator. Interact with the elevator to open it and walk inside.

Inside the elevator, interact with the interface. Hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and wait for the elevator to reach the top. Once the door opens you should move down if you are holding <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>. Exit the elevator

If you are running on the Nintendo Switch, you can perform the Long Elevator skip by simply entering the elevator and immediately exiting. No need to interact with the interface at all. Note that this is not a glitch and so it is allowed in glitchless categories.

## New Home

> The boring part of the run if you already know the story.

***Make sure you equip the Burnt Pan or Empty Gun and Cowboy Hat at some point after Mettaton but before Asgore.***

Go left once you enter New Home. Go into the living room. Walk towards the kitchen. On your way, you will get your first encounter. Mash <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to end the encounters as soon as possible. You will get many more after this one. Walk into the kitchen and grab the key. Leave the kitchen and go back and exit the living room back into the main room.

Walk right into the hallway and grab the key. Walk left and exit to the main room.

Unlock the gate, then go downstairs.

After that, just continue doing monstertale. There's nothing more to monstertale after this.

Once you reach the Judgement Hallway, **save at the save point.**

### Sans Judgement Skip

Walk down the Judgement hallway. When you hit the Sans trigger, leave the original window open while you open a new window to the main Continue/Reset menu. Wait until Sans's first dialogue box appears, then close the original window and press Continue on the new window. Reloading here makes Sans's dialogue skippable. After reloading, walk through the right and mash through all of Sans's dialogue.

Walk through judgement hall and into the hallway before the throne room. Enter the throne room and mash through the cutscene. Enter the barrier hallway and mash through the cutscene. After doing this, make sure you have the Burnt Pan or Empty Gun equipped, then enter the Barrier room.

### Asgore

Mash Asgore's text once you enter the Barrier room. Begin the fight.

If you have the pie, you can use it to lower Asgore's defense and attack.

On any other turn, you should choose to FIGHT, unless you need to do a safety heal.

This fight is why you got the Burnt Pan (or Empty Gun, but the idea is the same). The Burnt Pan is a weapon capable of dealing massive amounts of damage - far more than any other TPE / neutral weapon you're able to get optimally in a run.

However, to deal a lot of damage with the Pan, you must land a perfect hit. A perfect hit consists of landing 4 white bars frame-perfectly (1 frame window) in the center of the attack meter. This is very difficult to achieve but extremely rewarding.

There are three types of hits you can get with the Burnt Pan:

- A regular hit, which consists of landing 4 bars anywhere near the center. This deals around 180 - 210 damage depending on accuracy.
- A gold hit, which consists of landing 3 perfect hits and one regular, or 2 perfects and 2 very close hits. This deals around 260 damage.
- A quad, which consists of landing 4 perfect hits. This attack can do 500 or more damage, effectively doubling or tripling your normal damage.

The battle mostly consists of attempting to land the perfect hits to beat Asgore faster.

Asgore is by far the most difficult enemy to beat optimally. Don't expect to beat him very quickly your first few times fighting him.

After dealing the final blow, mash Asgore's text. The first part where everything fades away has un-mashable text, but after that it is mashable. After mashing all of his text, hold <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> and hit FIGHT.

Watch Asgore die and mash away Flowey's text. Once the game closes, quickly relaunch it. You can start opening the game early to minimize the loading time, but make sure you don't open it too early.

### Flowey

Once the game relaunches, mash <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> until Frisk appears. Walk up and interact with the save Point. Mash <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to end Flowey's text as soon as possible. Begin the fight.

From a speedrunning standpoint, Photoshop Flowey is mostly an autoscroller. The fight is fairly easy once you figure out how to dodge everything. Newer players might die to Flowey once during their 2nd or 3rd time fighting him, but after that it shouldn't be too difficult.

That being said, though, still try to dodge things. It's still possible to die to Flowey.

One important thing to note: You cannot die during the individual ‘soul’ phases with the ACT button. Take as much damage as you would like during these.

Here is what you should do during each phase:

- During the Spinning Knives phase, wait for the knives to move left or right. Move in the directions that the knives move, and go up to the very top of the screen on the side that the knives moved to. Wait around for an ACT button and hit it.
- During the Tough Glove phase, move a little bit to the left and then move to the top of the screen. You will notice a circle of gloves come out of the very top. On the left side of the circle, the ACT button will appear. Stay there to hit it as soon as possible.
- In the Ballet Shoes phase, simply hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> and hug the right side of the screen, and mash <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The ACT button will appear from the right. Staying inside the stars above you will ensure that you hit it as soon as possible.
- The book phase has a bit of RNG. There's a 50/50 chance that the ACT button will come out of either side of the books, so it's mostly a coin flip. You can just stay in the center and wait for the ACT button to appear. The ACT button will appear somewhere at the top portion of the area you can move in.
- In the Pan Phase, the ACT button will fly out of the middle pan. Just stay above the middle pan and wait for the ACT button to fly out, and hit it.
- The Gun Phase is a bit tricky. Move down to the bottom right of the screen and continue to hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>+<kbd>▶ Right</kbd>. Count the volley of bullets that the gun shoots. On the 8th volley of bullets, the gun will shoot the ACT button on the last shot. Hit the ACT button. Once the screen flashes and the gun shoots flowers, close the game.

Relaunch the game after closing it, or open the game early for a faster loading time. After relaunching the game, mash <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to clear Flowey's text.

For the last part of the fight, try to stay on the FIGHT button as much as possible. Try to stay within the rectangle so you can hit it as soon as possible.

There's a strategy to kill Flowey slightly faster than normal called Flowey Quick Kill, which involves delaying hitting certain FIGHT buttons with the correct timing. The FIGHT buttons to delay are #13, #25, and #36. See the video below and try to use the music to time the FIGHT button presses.

</div>

After dealing the last blow to Flowey, mash his text. When he circles you with bullets, edge yourself under the circle of bullets a bit so that when Flowey tries to hit you with the bullets, you hit them as soon as possible. After getting hit by the bullets, wait for Flowey to die.

There's another reload you can do during the fadeout when Flowey dies. The game saves when the screen finishes fading to white and starts fading to black, so you can open another copy of the game to load up this save early and save a couple seconds.

When you start to hear the wind sound effects, start to hold <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> for about a second, then mash <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to hit the FIGHT button. After Flowey's text appears, close the game and relaunch it, or open the game early for a faster load.

After launching the game, you will be in the final room with Flowey. Go up and around Flowey. Touch the Doorway.
