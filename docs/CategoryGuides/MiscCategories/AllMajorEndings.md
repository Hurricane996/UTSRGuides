# All Major Endings

<img src='./Images/UTSRGuidesHeader.png'></img>

## Introduction
All Major Endings is a very long marathon category. While the world record is around four and a half hours, a beginner runner can expect a time closer to six hours. It entails completing the Genocide, True Pacifist, and 8 different neutral endings. 

## Route Notes
### Preparation
It is recommended that runners be somewhat familiar with the Neutral run, as many of the tricks and strategies are the same. It is also a good idea to have at least a passing familiarity with the genocide route, as you will have to complete a mostly unmodified genocide route to get the Alphys and Genocide Endings. For segments where the strat is similar to an existing part of Neutral or True pacifist, a brief overview will be provided along with a link to the section to explain it in detail.

### Endings
You must complete at least one of each of the following Major Endings. The numbers in parentheses correspond to the ending numbers on this flowchart: https://imgur.com/6wNQy8i

#### True Pacifist Ending (65-68)
Complete any True Pacifist Ending.

#### Genocide Ending (90-93)
Complete any Genocide Ending.

#### Family Ending/Betrayed Undyne Ending (31-64)
Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Papyrus, and Undyne alive and less than 10 kills.

#### Exiled Queen Ending (5-30)
Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel alive and at least one of the following: 
- 10 or more kills
- Papyrus dead
- Undyne dead.

####  Undyne Ending (69-74)
- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel dead and Undyne alive.

#### Mettaton Ending (75-80)
- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel and Undyne dead and Mettaton alive.

#### Papyrus Ending (81-85)
- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, and Mettaton dead and Papyrus alive.

#### Dog Ending (86)
- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus dead and exactly 4 kills (those kills being the aformentioned monsters).

#### No King Ending (87-88)
- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus dead, a murder level of less than 12, and a number of kills that is not 4.

#### Alphys Ending (89)
- Complete the Neutral Ending with Toriel, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus dead, and a murder level of 12 or higher.


### Branch Order
The run is made up of 3 different branches: the Genocide branch (Papyrus, Alphys, Genocide), Pacifist branch (Family, Exiled Queen, TPE), and Neutral branch (Undyne, Mettaton, Dog and No King).  This guide assumes you will be doing the branches in the order Genocide; Neutral; Pacifist. It is possible to swap the order of these branches with only minimal routing changes, however having the genocide branch first will save a few seconds due to avoiding a cutscene with Flowey, as well as potentially saving a turn on Mettaton depending on RNG. 

### Saving
The reason this run is 4 hours long instead of 10 is due to a large amount of routing around **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>** points. A key strategy in this route is to save the game, get one ending, then reload to that save point and get another ending. Unfortunately this means that after certain points in the run, you will not be able to SAVE, and doing so will lose anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Any time where you will need to save the game will be marked like this: **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>**. After that point, until you reload to that save, you should not save again.

## Papyrus Ending
Requirements: 
- Toriel Dead
- Papyrus Alive
- Undyne Dead
- Mettaton Dead

In the Papyrus ending, we will first start a genocide route to gain EXP for bosses later on. We will then save before Papyrus so we can reload and finish genocide later. 

### Ruins
Ruins routing is identical to genocide. For in-depth details check out the [Genocide Guide](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Genocide?id=Ruins).

Overview:
- Goal is 20 Kills
- If you don't do Toriel Ass Warp, kill the first froggit. It does not count towards the kill counter for Ruins.
- Kill 11 enemies alternating between the Leaf Pile room and the room after it. These enemies will randomly be either Froggits or Whimsuns, with Froggits being the slower option.
- Kill a 12th enemy on th eright side of the room after Leaf Pile. 
- Kill a 13th enemy in the One Rock Room.
- Grind to all 20 kills in the 3 rock room, leaving and entering each time. Encounters can be Froggit/Whimsun, triple Moldsmall, single Moldsmall, double Moldsmall, or double froggit.
- Continue through ruins normally. You will know you are on the Genocide route if Napstablook disappears.
- Do not get the Toy Knife, it is useless.
- If you need the pie as healing for sans or UTU, you can grab it if you'd like.
- Fight and Kill Toriel, she should die in one shot.

### Snowdin
Snowdin is the point in our run where we will diverge from the genocide route. Unfortunately, we are not able to kill all of the monsters in Snowdin because doing so would make the Nice Cream Man disappear, forcing us to complete Genocide without the punch card. Because of this, we will save immediately before exhausting the Snowdin kill count, then continue on with the papyrus ending.

#### Snowdin Forest
Walk right down the long hallway, be prepared to mash when you meet Sans. You will enter a cutscene with Sans and Papyrus talking. Mash all of their text. After the cutscene, continue right. Sans will talk again right before leaving the room, so prepare to mash again.

In the next room, interact with the save point to bring your health back to full. You will need to have health for a skip later in the game. 

After interacting with the save point, go over to the box and take out the tough glove. If you have the pie, put it in the box first and then take everything out. This ensures that the pie is the 2nd item in your inventory. Open your menu and equip the tough glove. This will put the stick in the first inventory slot. Grind out your first kill on the right side of the room. It will be a guaranteed snowdrake.  Continue to the next room.

Mash through the next cutscene, and continue along the path.

There is an 11% chance to get a phone call somewhere in the middle of the path that wastes time. Prepare to mash in case you get the phone call.

There is also an unavoidable encounter in the room. This encounter is guaranteed to be an ice cap. Kill it (2 TOTAL KILLS). After Ice Cap, proceed to Doggo

Doggo **does not count** towards the Snowdin kill count, however killing him is necessary to complete geno. Hit him twice to kill him.

Getting hit by Doggo's attack as soon as possible by holding right is the fastest option.

#### Papyrus' Puzzles...?
In the room with the frozen pond, do not slide across the ice. Instead, encounter Lesser Dog. Kill it. It is slightly faster to pet it first to lower it's defense, and then kill it (3 TOTAL KILLS).

If you would like the Snowman Pieces as healing items for Sans or UTU, grab them. Make sure you grind out Lesser dog before entering the upper room, and then grind out another encounter, which will be a guaranteed Ice Cap. Kill it and remember that you have an extra kill.

In the room with the ball game, cross the bridge and continue down and to the right, making sure to not get stuck on the snowdecahedron.

In the next room, go right then mash when the cutscene starts. Walk past the paper on the ground. Mash through the cutscene, then continue right into the next room.

Continue right through the room with the cold spaghetti. Don’t bother saving, as it only loses time.

In the snow puzzle room, the switch in the top right will already be pressed. Head straight down to the Dogi. You will get an encounter on the way. It will either be an Ice Cap and Jerry, or an Ice Cap, Chilldrake, and Jerry. Kill the Ice Cap and the Chilldrake if there is one, but flee from Jerry. He isn't worth your time. At this point you will have anywhere from 4 to 6 Kills.

After this, kill the Dogi. Be sure to kill Dogaresa first. The Dogi **DO NOT COUNT** towards the kill count.

You can continue thorough both XO puzzle rooms without worry, they are already solved for you. Similarly, the colored tile puzzle will not activate so you can simply mash through it.

The ice puzzle is also already solved for you, so simply head towards the bridge and continue onward.

Finally, there is the snow poff room and greater dog. Kill him. **HE DOES NOT COUNT** towards the kill count.

#### The Snowdin Grind
Activate the Gauntlet of Deadly Terror cutscene and mash it. Once it's done, immediately exit on the *left side of the room*. Return and start the Snowdin grind. Make sure to leave and reenter after every encounter.

You cannot finish the Snowdin kill grind. If you do, you will not be able to obtain the punch card later on in the Papyrus Ending. Instead, you want to stop the grind right before reasching the correct number of kills. Once your kill count is at or above 11, you want to cross to the right side of the bridge, and grind out 1 more encounter. This will take you to anywhere from 12 to 14 kills. At this point, head into town and **<span style="color: orange">SAVE</span>**. This is the longest instance of going without a save in the run. From here on out, you are not able to save the game. This makes softlocks particularly dangerous, so it is recommended to be relatively conservative with which tricks you attempt during this part of the run.

Continue onwards and fight Papyrus. You will want to spare him, however the fastest way to get him to a sparable state is to FIGHT him until his HP gets low. Continue to hit Papyrus with accurate hits until he uses his special attack. At this point, spare him. He will use his Really Cool Regular Attack. After this, he will grant you mercy, and you can spare him again to finish the fight.

### Watrerfall
#### The Beginning of Waterfall
In the Waterfall and falling rocks room, hold right until you get to the middle of the waterfall, then press up a bit and go back down a bit when you’re about to reach the end of the waterfall.

In the next room, perform [Sea Grass Skip](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Waterfall) as you normally would. Continue as normal through the 2 bridge puzzle rooms, the telescope room, spears 1, and Gaster. Dropping the stick is an option, but only really worth doing if you don't have any healing items.

#### The Punch Card and Ballet Shoes
If you are on versions 1.02+, go to the punch card room, grab the punch card as normal, then go to the ballet shoes room and grab the ballet shoes.

If you are on versions 1.0-1.001, there is a faster strategy you can do called Early Ballet shoes. First, put all your items (if you have any) in the box. Then go to the punch card room and buy *two* nice creams. Eat them both, and take one punch card out of the box. Overflow the box, and you will get a set of Ballet Shoes. Equip them. You can leave your stuff in the box if you want, you don't really need any of it for this ending.

Regardless, continue onwards, as you would in neutral, through the Onionsans room, monster kid rooms, and spears 2.

#### Mad Dummy
Because Mad Dummy Skip requires a save, you cannot do it during this ending. Instead, you have to do the older 5-cycle strat. If you're particularly used to mad dummy, the astronaut food provides a convenient healing source that only loses a handful of frames. 

Walk into the Mad Dummy cutscene. If you'd like, you can do something similar to the first part of the mad dummy screen, where you walk downwards to scroll the screen. However this doesn't save very much time at all and requires a particularly quick overflow.

Mash the text from the Mad Dummy cutscene and begin the battle.

Once the battle begins, move to MERCY and Spare the Mad Dummy. You will do this action for the rest of the battle.

In the first phase of the Mad Dummy fight, you are trying to deal as much damage to Mad Dummy using the Dummy’s cotton balls.

There is a way to complete the first phase of Mad Dummy in 5 attacks. Consult the photo below to see how to complete the fight in the minimum attacks.

<img src='./Images/5CycleMadDummy.png' alt="5 cycle Mad Dummy positions" title="5 cycle Mad Dummy positions"></img>

You don’t need to hit the dummy in the rocket stages. After the battle, mash Napstablook’s text and proceed upwards.

After this, continue through waterfall as normal. The most important skips and tricks will be recapped here. For more detailm consult [the Neutral Guide](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Waterfall).

#### Napstablook Skip

This skip can be performed fairly quickly right after entering the room. PCE the trigger for Napstablook. After PCEing the trigger, move up and right, and then move right and exit to Gerson’s shop hallway.

<img src='./Images/NapstablookSkip.png' alt="Napstablook Skip PCE" title="Napstablook Skip PCE"></img>

Alternatively, you can wrong warp into the room and open your punch card before the cutscene activates. You will gain movement back again after closing the punch card again. This method is slightly faster.

With both methods, you can also use the few moments where Napstablook is leaving the room to wrong warp in the next room. After getting the skip, go right, mash 3 lines of text, then mash the last line of text after you walk a little bit past the sign. Hold up and right as you enter the transition, and let go afterward to perform the wrong warp.

#### The EXP Check (IMPORTANT)
At some point during Waterfall, you need to check what your EXP is. This route has you very close to saving a turn on Mettaton, so to save that turn you need to buff your attack. The two ways to do this are to kill Vulkin and to buy and use a Legendary Hero.

- If you currently have 630 EXP or more, then killing Vulkin is the fastest way to buff your attack.
- If you currently have 629 EXP or fewer, then killing Vulkin will not work and you will have to buy a Legendary hero anyway.
- Alternatively, buying a legendary hero always works and loses less than a second if you do it when you don't have to.

Remember for later whether your EXP was high or low. 

#### Flowerflow
In the next room, a somewhat complicated trick called flowerflow is used to shorten the distance needed to walk after the cutscene. Overflow the flower, close the punch card, then open the punch card again while also closing the “Behind You” text. This is done by X and then Enter (or otherwise any button to finish text followed by a button to close the text) in the window where you cannot close the punch card. Next walk towards the left of the room. Be careful not to walk too far that the screen scrolls or the part in the cutscene where Undyne carries Monster Kid away will be longer. Open your menu, ready to use the punch card. You can also use the cell phone instead, which is slightly easier. When undyne starts talking, use the punch card or cell phone and mash through her text. After Undyne has finished talking, quickly reopen the punch card/cell phone. If you do not open the punch card or cell phone fast enough, you will lose movement. Wait for monster kid to start talking and mash away the punch card/cell phone and continue mashing away text in the rest of the cutscene.

Once the cutscene is over, walk left to where the path upwards will be. Optionally, you can info the punch card near the end of this part so that when the path appears, you will have text storage and will be able to OWW to the next room. Otherwise, wrong warp normally into the next room.

If you fail any part of flowerflow, continue mashing away the rest of the cutscene normally. Flowerflow saves 5 seconds.

#### Monster Kid Bridge Skip

In the Monster Kid Bridge room, PCE the trigger for the cutscene. The trigger is near the last support of the bridge. NOTE: If you wrong warped into the room, you will hit the trigger at a slightly different place than if you just walked into the room. After PCEing the cutscene, walk to the right and go to the next room.

This is the trigger if you wrong warped into the room as most runners do. If you do not wrong warp into the room, the trigger will be 1 pixel to the right.

<img src='./Images/MonsterKidBridgeSkip.png' alt="Monster Kid Bridge Skip trigger" title="Monster Kid Bridge Skip trigger"></img>

You can walk back out of the room after the Monster Kid Bridge skip and wrong warp back in to save a tiny bit of time.

#### Undyne
There are a variety of different ways to shorten or the Undyne boss fight, just like in Neutral - however the options are a little bit different. 

First Trigger:

<img src='./Images/UndyneFirstTrigger.png' alt="Undyne first trigger" title="Undyne first trigger"></img>

Second Trigger:

<img src='./Images/UndyneSecondTrigger.png' alt="Undyne second trigger" title="Undyne second trigger"></img>

Wrong Warp Position:

<img src='./Images/UndyneWrongWarp.png' alt="Undyne wrong warp position" title="Undyne wrong warp position"></img>

##### Method 1 (easiest)
Run into both triggers, as you would in glitchless.
##### Method 2 (easy)
PCE the first trigger, then run into the second trigger. This will save just a couple of seconds over method 1.
##### Method 3 (medium)
PCE the first trigger, quickly PCE the second trigger, then walk into the second room. Let Undyne catch you, then kill her. Go back down to the first room and wrong warp into the second room. This saves about 20 seconds over method 3.
##### Method 4 (hard)
This is the same as Onedyne in neutral. If you already know onedyne, you should continue to implement it here, but if not I would just stick to method 3 which is only slightly slower in terms of speed. 

Walk into the room and begin moving up the path. PCE the first trigger. You will need to PCE the second trigger extremely quickly after PCEing the first to pull this off. After PCEing the 2nd trigger, PCA Undyne’s text and mash it until you get to the “Here I come” text. This text will disappear 30 frames after it appears, and you will want to be in the room transition when the text disappears. After this, walk through the second room. Continue onto the third room, walk right until undyne catches you, and then kill her. This method saves a few seconds over method 3. A video guide for this method can be seen below.

</div>

#### Undyne Part 2
In terms of actually killing Undyne, there aren't really any tips. The arrow attacks are the same every time so you can memorize them, but other than that you just want to hit her with the ballet shoes until she dies. Once you get her health down to 0 and she starts shimmering, that is effectively a cutscene and you can switch to sparing her.

##### Pacifist Kindergarten
There is a harder strat called Pacifist Kindergarten. TODO describe pacifist kindergarten.

There are more wrong warps you can do after Undyne, but they only save a small amount of time. 

### Hotland
Get very used to doing hotland. You will pass through hotland a bunch during the game, and it's always the same as neutral.

If I transcribed the whole Hotland section over from neutral every time, this doc would be a thousand pages long. [Here's the link](/CategoryGuides/MainCategories/Neutral?id=Hotland) to the Neutral guide's section on Hotland.

When you encounter Vulkin, kill it if your EXP is HIGH (>=630). You should level up. If you don't, you misremembered your EXP and will have to buy a Hero later.

After activating the first cutscene in Core, but before getting your menu back, go to the Burgerpants shop and buy a Legendary Hero if your EXP is LOW (<630), or if you're unsure.

#### Mettaton
Mettaton consists of two phases. During the first phase, Mettaton is invulnerable. Once you hit the second phase he will be vulnerable to attack.  Before the fight, you can PCE the trigger and walk to the other side of the room, but this can be slightly risky as there's a chance the moving platform will push you out of the room. Once Mettaton says "Attack of the killer robot!", clear that text and then open the punch card.

##### First Phase
- During the first attack, SPARE. Mash through the text, but be careful not to overmash and shoot mettaton. Shooting mettaton loses time.
- During the second attack, SPARE and don't get hit.
- During the third attack, SPARE and don't get hit.
- During the fourth attack, SPARE and don't get hit. The fourth attack will be the first one to have a bomb. 
- If you have a legendary hero, you should use it now. Otherwise, SPARE again.
- Finally, ACT and select the "Yellow" option and the fight will begin.
##### Second Phase.
- During the second attack, robots will rain down from the screen. Try to destroy them all if you can, this will shorten the turns.
- Attack 4 also has robots, again try to destroy them all.
- Attack 5 is an essay. It is slightly faster to type one character, but it is slightly more fun to type memes.
A perfect fight will end after attack 5. It is always faster to destroy robots when they appear, and to get as many hits on Mettaton's heart as possible when it appears.

Once Mettaton is over, you will have the punch card open. Wait until Alphys starts talking, then clsoe it and leaves the room

#### Alphys Elevator Skip.
In All Major Endings, there are some endings where Alphys Elevator skip must be done, some where it must not be done, and some where it doesn't matter. In this ending, it doesn't matter. I would still recommend doing it because it's fast, but don't worry if you miss it. Here is the description.

This is one of the most difficult PCEs in the run because of how inconsistent it is and that there is no clear visual indicator. Once you enter the hallway after Mettaton, hold up and right. Move down the hallway. Wait for the lights on the wall to go dark twice. Once they have done that, the lights will brighten up. Once the lights start to dim down from their brightest state, you will hit the trigger. The best visual indicator is the pattern along the left edge of the screen. This is a repeating pattern, but it will look like the image below when you hit the trigger.

<img src='./Images/AlphysElevatorSkip.png' alt="Alphys Skip trigger location" title="Alphys Skip trigger location"></img>

Once you PCE the trigger, continue to the right. As soon as Alphys begins to speak, PCA her textbox by opening and closing another punch card, but do not advance past her first textbox. When you get to the elevator, interact with it once with Z and do not mash until you see Alphys’s face appear. When Alphys’s face appears, mash the text and enter the elevator.

There’s a slightly faster version of this skip that involves clearing the textbox slightly earlier. Press Z slightly before reaching the elevator door, then press Z on the elevator door, then X, then wait half a second and press Z again while holding up. Make sure you’re not touching the walls of the elevator door when you enter it or you’ll softlock.

#### Long Elevator skip.
You can do long elevator skip like normal, but since you're still in no-save, there is another option. If after doing long elevator skip, you reenter the elevator, then ride it down and back up glitchless, this will create an autosave, which you will reload to if you die to Asgore. This takes a long time, so it's not recommended. 

### New Home
The first New Home of the run is the same boring slog as in Neutral. Subsequent New Homes are different, and I will describe those differences when we get to them. For now though, just do what you always do.

#### Judgement Hall
Judgement hall is a little bit different. You want to walk right in the Judgement hallway, and PCE the trigger for the cutscene like normal. After doing that, quickly close the Punch Card and walk right. Keep holding right until Sans’ silhouette is fully visible.

This is the key difference. Once his silhouette is fully visible, stop holding right. Wait for sans to start talking. Once you see the first textbox, hold up-right. This will set a flag that lets you skip Sans dialogue later on in the game.

### Flowey
Beyond this, Asgore and Flowey are the same as in neutral. Asgore is slightly faster since you're higher LV, but Flowey is literally identical (the Neutral and All Major Endings TASes use the same inputs). Once you've finished the flowey fight, be sure to wait until you see the Undertale logo before closing the game. Otherwise, you'll have to fight flowey again later which loses 10 minutes.
