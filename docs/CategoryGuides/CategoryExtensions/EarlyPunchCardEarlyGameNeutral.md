# Early Punch Card Early Game/Neutral

<img src='./Images/UTSRGuidesHeader.png'></img>

## Introduction  

Early Punch Card Early Game is a Category Extension where you start at the beginning of ruins with a save file with the Punch Card in your inventory, and end when entering the Punch Card Room in Waterfall. This category is quite short, with the world record clocking in at just over 14 minutes, and contains many glitches throughout the game. Because of the difficulty of the run, it is not recommended for new runners.

Early Punch Card Neutral is a Category Extension similar to Early Punch Card Early Game, but with the main difference being that it ends after completing the Neutral ending. The Early Punch Card Neutral route follows the Early Punch Card Early Game route until after spears 1, then converges with the Neutral route for the rest of the run. An expert runner in Early Punch Card Neutral could expect a time under 50 minutes, while a good estimate for a run in Early Punch Card Neutral would be about 4-5 minutes faster than your Neutral time.

The save files for this category can be found at this link: [Save File](https://www.speedrun.com/undertalecategoryextensions/resources/ki8vk)

## Ruins

Unlike most Undertale categories, Early Punch Card Early Game begins upon selecting continue off of a save file. As such, there is also not the standard 6 second wait after starting the game before you can move. Make sure that you are holding right once you select continue so that you may move immediately. Hold right and enter the room with flowey.

### Flowey Skip
The encounter with the first flowey can be skipped with a PCE slide. PCE slide onto the trigger and start to mash away the text. When you are on the last text box, enter the room transition on the bottom while holding against one of the invisible walls. The last text box reads: “Ready? Here we go!”

</p>

After exiting the flowey room, re-enter the room. Assuming you got the trick, flowey will no longer be where he should be. Instead, Toriel will appear in the room after a few seconds. If flowey is still there, the last textbox was not closed, and you can attempt the trick again. Note: There will be a different amount of text boxes upon attempting the trick again, so be careful. If the screen is black upon reentry, you were not holding against a wall when walking out.

Mash away Toriel’s text and hold up. Once you reach the door, Wrong Warp into the next room. Walk up either of the staircases and continue to Wrong Warp into the room with the 6 buttons. Continue into the room with toriel’s switches, but do not Wrong Warp into this room. After hitting the switches and mashing Toriel's text, continue into the room with the Dummy. Mash Toriel’s text and interact with the Dummy. ACT on the Dummy and select “Talk”.

After finishing the fight with the Dummy, Wrong Warp into the handhold room, skipping the entire cutscene. This next Wrong Warp is somewhat special. If you walk into the long hallway room, an invisible barrier appears and you will not be able to transition into the previous room, meaning you will have to walk through the entire long hallway. As a result, you must do this Wrong Warp without transitioning into the long hallway room. Luckily, though, this Wrong Warp skips essentially all of the long hallway room.

### Ruins and Encounters

Encounters play an interesting role in the Early Punch Card speedrun. Because a Wrong Warp usually puts Frisk further into the room than normal, it also reduced the chances of getting an encounter in a room. It may make some encounters impossible, for others it may simply reduce the chances of an encounter, and further still might make an encounter that would normally be guaranteed become a chance. For the rest of this guide, many of the minor wrong warps will not be mentioned, while major wrong warps that either skip cutscenes or long sections of walking will be mentioned.

Walk towards the exit at the bottom right of the room. If an enemy is encountered, either flee from it if it is a froggit or spare it if it is a whimsun. There is an optional skip in the pitfall room. You can PCE the trigger on the hole to gain movement during this cutscene. Open the Punch Card and leave it open while Frisk is falling. Once the room at the bottom of the screen is visible, close the Punch Card and hold right. Enter the door to warp back up to the top of the room and Wrong
Warp out of the room into the One Rock Room.

</div>

In the one rock room, push the rock to the end of the path until the rock is at the end of the path. After the rock is at the end of the path, hold right and open and close the Punch Card. This has the effect of skipping Toriel’s phone call in this room.

</div>

There is an optional strategy in the maze room where you PCE the maze, and hold Up+Right to get to the end of the room. This strat is quite precise, as it requires a quick close of the punch card in order to avoid a softlock, though it can save about a second if done quickly.

</div>

After completing the maze, enter the three rock room. Ignore the top 2 rocks. Talk to the 3rd rock from the right side, as it’s faster to get pushed by the rock. If you get an encounter while talking to the rock you can perform a glitch known as Rock Skip that saves 1-2 seconds depending on how many times you have talked to the rock to that point.

Optionally, in this room you can overflow the rock to get text storage on the third time interacting with the rock, and close the text after walking right a bit to save some time and increase the chance of getting a rock skip.

</div>

In the room with Napstablook, walk up to him and mash away the text. Go to ACT and select “cheer” for the first 3 turns, and then on the 4th turn select either “cheer” or “flirt”. Make sure not to select anything else, as that can result in an extra turn at best and 2 minutes of timeloss at worst. Note: We will skip the cutscene later in ruins where Toriel heals you, so taking damage during this fight will mean that you have less HP during the Toriel fight. If you take damage here, you can save-heal outside of toriel’s house, but this will lose time.

After sparing Napstablook, walk up and right and exit the room.

### The Rest of Ruins

In the next room, simply walk to the end and mash away Toriel’s text. There’s a small chance you’ll get an encounter here.

In the room with the 6 pit traps, overflow the sign, continue to the top right trap. When you enter the trap close the trap and hold Up and Right to exit the room, bypassing the switch in the room.

Video Demonstration:
<div style=" max-width: 1280px; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: flex;">

</div>

In the first perspective room, just walk down left to exit. In the second, interact with the first switch behind the pillar. In the third, interact with the switch behind the pillar at the end of the room. In the fourth, interact with the switch behind the pillar in the top left. The chance of getting an encounter is pretty unlikely, except for the fourth room where one is almost guaranteed. Wrong Warping into the third and fourth perspective rooms saves time and reduces the chance of an encounter.

Wrong Warp into the room outside of Toriel’s house, and then walk into Toriel's house. In the house, mash her text and then walk right. After she introduces you to your room, walk back left.

Talk to Toriel in the living room. Count how many choicers she gives you. On the 4th one, select the rightmost option. If you miss it, you can just talk to Toriel once more and select the rightmost option. Mash her text and follow her into the basement.

There is a very slight optimization in talking to toriel that can save a bit under a second. By overflowing and then immediately again talking to Toriel, you will replace the second string of dialogue with a copy of the first, reducing the total number of text boxes needed to mash.

Video Demonstration:

</div>

Keep following her and mashing. There are optional Wrong Warps that you can do to save minimal amounts of time.

### Toriel Cutscene Skip (PCE Slide) Setup
For the Toriel fight, PCE Slide into the trigger for the toriel cutscene, mash away the text, and open the punch card. There is an invisible wall preventing you from skipping the fight entirely, but you can skip the cutscene at the end of the fight. Leave the Punch Card open while starting the fight.

### The Toriel Fight

This is the most RNG intensive part of the game, but also the last major RNG part. Keep sparing her throughout the fight, other options are pointless.

Toriel has many different attacks, but there are 2 we’ll be looking for: her hand attacks. You’ll want to run into the hands as soon as possible, since running into them ends the turn immediately, saving time. Each hand saves about 5 seconds.

The entire battle is 13 turns long, but the 13th turn is always harmless so realistically it’s only 12 turns long. You can get 6 non-hand attacks before losing time.

A good strategy is to count the turns in your head. When you’re at the later turns and your HP is still pretty high, start taking damage. The goal is to be at 3 HP entering the 12th turn, since getting hit at 3 HP also causes a turn cancel. Don’t worry about this if she’s giving you lots of hands.

There’s also another strategy you can do to get 8 hands instead of 6. View the gif below.

<p align="center">
    <img src='./Images/8HandStrat.gif' alt='This attack deals 1hp, allowing for 8-hand Toriel strats.' title='This attack deals 1hp, allowing for 8-hand Toriel strats.'></img>
</p>

In this attack, the hitbox that spawns the fireballs is bigger than the actual fireballs. That means, with some careful positioning, you can take only 1 HP of damage. This allows you to get damaged by 2 more hand attacks, which saves around 10 seconds with good RNG. Note that this can only be done when you’re at 8 or higher HP, and it can only be done once. Doing it more than once is just a waste of health.

There is an even faster strategy that can potentially lead to 9 hands. Every time there’s a hand attack, there’s a 50/50 chance that a hand will spawn from the bottom. This hand does 3 damage instead of the usual 4. By hitting three bottom hands before reaching 7 or lower HP, you can get up to 9 hands total. If you only manage to hit two bottom hands, you still get a setup for 8 hands and if you only manage to hit one bottom hand, you get a setup for 7 hands. This is the most optimal way to do the Toriel fight RTA, if you’re able to react to the attack patterns fast enough.

After Toriel stops talking, just mash Z and Enter. When the battle starts fading out get ready to skip the cutscene

### Toriel Cutscene Skip
After the fight ends, wait for toriel to start talking. You should have the punch card open. Close the punch card once toriel’s dialogue opens and walk out of the room. Walk back into the room, and wrong warp past the long hallway. Wrong Warp once more past flowey, and touch the door to leave ruins

## Snowdin

### Sans Skip

Wrong warp into the room with the sans cutscene either by overflowing the hidden camera or manually Wrong Warping. PCE Slide onto the cutscene trigger, close the Punch Card, and continue to the end of the room. Unlike in other categories, DO NOT SAVE at the save point and do not remove the stick from the box.

Video Demonstration:
<div style=" max-width: 1280px; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: flex;">

</div>

Continue into the room with the Sans and Papyrus cutscene. You cannot skip this cutscene due to an invisible wall, so mash through the cutscene and continue right into the Doggo room.

In the Doggo room, overflow the sign and skip the cutscene starting the doggo fight. Continue right and exit the room.

### Electric Maze Skip

Slide on the ice in the next room to prevent the step counter from continuing and skipping an encounter. In the electric maze room, mash away the first cutscene, PCE Slide into the second cutscene, and walk out of the room.

</div>

There is an alternate strat for this room that is a tiny bit slower but much safer version of the Electric maze skip. After mashing through the first cutscene, buffer or walk left 2 pixels, then PCE Slide to the left, you should have the punch card open and dialogue from papyrus. Close the punch card, and continue right through the entire room, as the triggers for the cutscene are now disabled.

In the room with the ball game, cross the bridge and continue down and to the right, making sure to not get stuck on the snowdecahedron.

### Papyrus Puzzle Skip

In the papyrus puzzle room, mash through the first cutscene, and walk to the paper on the ground. Overflow the paper, and close the punch card quickly so that the puzzle is still open. You should still have movement. Walk to the right and close the puzzle when papyrus starts talking

There is an alternate strat for this room that is a tiny bit slower but much safer version of the Papyrus Puzzle Skip. After mashing through the first cutscene, buffer or walk left 3 pixels, then PCE Slide to the left, you should have the punch card open and dialogue from papyrus. Close the punch card, and continue right through the entire room, as the triggers for the cutscene are now disabled. Additionally, you can PCA the text and close the third text box during the room transition for a substantial wrong warp

### Dog Marriage Skip

Continue right through the room with the cold spaghetti. Don’t bother saving, as it only loses time.

In the Snow puzzle room, immediately head to the switch to the top right of the room. Overflow the switch. After that you should encounter the lesser dog. Flee from him. Head downwards and cross the bridge. The Dog Couple cutscene will begin. Close the text box and exit the room.

</div>

### More Papyrus’ Puzzles

In the first XO tile puzzle room, turn the Xs into Os and hit the switch, then walk over to Papyrus. While walking down past the sign, overflow the sign to get text storage. When papyrus starts talking, close the sign text and continue to the next room on the right.

As an advanced strat, after overflowing the sign, walk into the papyrus cutscene before touching the second X. Once papyrus starts talking, close the text box and finish the rest of the puzzle. Mash through papyrus’ text until he says “Nyeh heh heh” close the text during the room transition for a wrong warp.

Video Demonstration:
<div style=" max-width: 1280px; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: flex;">

</div>

In the second XO tile puzzle room, go to the first tree on the top of the room and activate the switch hidden inside it. Head towards the pressure plate, mash Papyrus’ text, PCE Slide onto the pressure plate, then continue to the room to the right.

As an advanced strat, overflow the switch in the tree and use the text to gain movement during the cutscene where papyrus walks to you and starts talking. While you cannot activate the switch during this cutscene, as doing so will result in a softlock, you can instead line yourself up on the pixel before the button, preferably on the right side as it is faster, and then PCE slide on the button once papyrus is done talking, saving yourself the time it would take to setup the pixel, and a few frames in movement.

</div>

The next room is the Colored tile puzzle room. Walk across the bridge and mash Papyrus’ dialogue. You will want to be careful here. He will ask you a question after a large amount of dialogue. Answer the 2nd choice. After this, another large set of dialogue will need to be mashed away. This is followed by yet another question. Answer the 2nd choice to this question as well. If you accidentally enter in the 1st choice on either question, you will have to wait out the color tile puzzle cutscene, which loses a large amount of time. After Papyrus exits the room, walk right past the tiles and enter the next room.

### Ice Puzzle Skip

This is a simple, yet somewhat difficult, trick due to it requiring a pixel perfect position. This trick saves 4-5 seconds due to skipping the bridge cutscene after the ice puzzle.

There are 4 ways to do this trick, with increasing levels of precision required.

The first method is known as glitchless ice puzzle, and is very simple. Note that as you don’t do the bridge cutscene skip it does lose 5 seconds. It can be done by following the path below.

<img src='./Images/GlitchlessIcePuzzle.png' alt="Path for glitchless ice puzzle" title="Path for glitchless ice puzzle"></img>

The second method is known as just Ice Puzzle Skip, and can be performed by following the steps below.

The route you will take can be seen in Picture A.

<img src='./Images/IcePuzzleSkip.png' alt="Path for standard ice puzzle skip" title="Path for standard ice puzzle skip"></img>

On the second to last tile, stop on the very bottom of that tile then slide to the right.

Once you arrive at the last tile, you should be in a position similar to Picture B. From that position, you will need to move two pixels to the left. The position you will need to be in will look like Picture C.

You can use your menu to ‘buffer’ your steps. Basically use your menu to stop yourself. Hit a direction + the menu button at the same time. Alternatively, you can just move left two pixels without menu buffering, but menu buffering makes it much more consistent.

After being in the right position, press <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> on the same frame. Alternatively you can open the menu, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> and <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> with the menu open, and close the menu. You will slide to the pressure plate. While you are sliding, let go of the <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> arrow key, and only hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>. If done correctly, you will skip the bridge building cutscene, and slide across the bridge like normal.

The third method is known as Icebreaker, and is performed similarly to ice puzzle skip. This method eliminates the need to move left two pixels on the final tile, which can save time for some runners. However, the movement is slightly more difficult. Upon entering the room, hold <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> to rub against the bottom corner. You then hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>, <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>+<kbd>◀ Left</kbd>, <kbd>▲ Up</kbd>, and <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>+<kbd>◀ Left</kbd>. You then have to release <kbd>◀ Left</kbd> for a few frames when you’re over the top tile in the middle so you can hit the bottom tile. You then continue going down+left, and then up, left, and up again. Stop on the first pixel that activates the top tile, as shown below.

<img src='./Images/IPSFirstPixelTopTile.png' alt="First pixel that activates the top tile" title="First pixel that activates the top tile"></img>

Then, hold <kbd>▶ Right</kbd>, followed by <kbd>▼ Down</kbd>+<kbd>▶ Right</kbd> once you start sliding on the ice, followed by <kbd>▶ Right</kbd> again after you start sliding again but before you hit the button.

If you miss the bottom tile in the middle while performing icebreaker, there is a backup you can do so you don’t have to redo the entire puzzle. By moving up to a specific pixel on the upper left tile, you’ll be able to move down+right to the tile you missed and up+right to the final tile. Then you set up for the cutscene skip on the final tile by moving down and left one pixel.

</div>

The fourth method is known as Masochist Ice Puzzle. This is a very difficult strat that saves only 0.5 seconds. It is not recommended to attempt this trick in runs, as it requires multiple pixel perfect setups and difficult movement. The route for Masochist Ice Puzzle skip, along with the rest of the Ice Puzzle variants can be seen in the following video demonstration.

<div style=" max-width: 1280px; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: flex;">

</div>

If you mess up and fall after triggering the bridge, walk back up and just go across to the bridge.

Overflow a snow poff in the Greater Dog room, and use it to skip the Greater dog fight. Wrong Warp into the next room.

Video Demonstration:
<div style=" max-width: 1280px; aspect-ratio: 16/9; display: flex;">

</div>

The Cutscene here is unskippable due to an invisible wall, so walk into the trigger and mash though the cutscene. After the cutscene, hold right towards snowdin, and Wrong Warp into Snowdin.

### Papyrus Fight

The Papyrus fight is not skippable because of an invisible wall, so we have to play through the fight like normal.

Note that we do not have the Stick in this run, so we must check papyrus instead of using the stick when necessary. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE STICK. You will accidentally rip the punch card

Walk down the hallway. Once the silhouette of both Frisk and Papyrus appear, Papyrus will begin to talk. Mash all the text and begin the battle.

This is the easiest boss fight in the entire run.

Select ACT and CHECK Papyrus. Mash away the text. Papyrus’ speech bubble contains unskippable text but you will be able to end the dialogue very early, so mash Enter and Z.

If you accidentally use SPARE instead of CHECK, Papyrus will use his blue attack which can lose upwards of 12 seconds.

After throwing the Checking, purposely run into the bones and take damage. Repeat this for 2 more turns. On the 3rd turn you will be put at 1 HP, and Papyrus will send you to his garage.

After being sent back to Papyrus’ garage, head back to him and mash his text again. Once you are in the fight with him, spare him instead Checking, and purposely get knocked down to 1 HP. Repeat this process one more time.

When you return to him the 4th time, Papyrus will let you choose to fight him again or to not fight him again. Choose the second choice to not fight him again. You need to be careful here because choosing the first choice to fight him again will cause you to lose almost a minute.

After choosing the second choice, Papyrus will give up on fighting you and spare you. Mash the large amount of dialogue. After that Papyrus will fly away.

## Waterfall

### The Beginning of Waterfall

Keep walking right. Don’t save.

In the Waterfall and falling rocks room, hold right until you get to the middle of the waterfall, then press up a bit and go back down a bit when you’re about to reach the end of the waterfall. Wrong Warp past the Sea Grass Cutscene

### Petals

In the second flower bridge room, go right towards the bridge. You will get an unavoidable encounter just before the bridge. Flee from the encounter with Aaron. After walking across the bridge, go up and towards the flowers. Throw the flowers upwards from the bottom ledge extending from the right. With the fourth flower in hand, throw it from the right and complete the bridge. After dropping the 4th flower, you can drop the stick for a small timesave later. Keep the stick in TPE.

After crossing the flower bridge in the second flower bridge room, you will get a phone call from Papyrus. Mash Papyrus’ text and go through the doorway at the top.
In the telescope puzzle room, go right and skip the telescope. Head upwards at the turn and go towards the secret exit. You will get an unavoidable encounter with Woshua somewhere near the telescope. Flee from Woshua. Interact with the wall at the top to reveal the hidden doorway. Enter the doorway.

Alternatively, you can overflow the door and perform a cutscene warp with it. A video demonstration can be seen below

Overflow a sign and close it after walking onto the wooden platform. When you step on the platform, close the text and hold right to move at double speed

### Spears 1 Skip (PCE)
In the spears 1 room, you can PCE the cutscene to get movement during the cutscene. This saves a few seconds, but also has the side effect of changing the angle that undyne will throw her spears at you. You will likely need to use a different dodging pattern to be able to fully dodge the spears because of this change

As an advanced strat in this room, you can info the punch card just as the cutscene for spears 1 ends, and use the second text box to wrong warp, saving about 2 seconds

In the second room of the chase, literally just hold right to avoid the spears. After avoiding the spears and reaching the end, keep holding right so you will move as soon as the cutscene ends. After exiting the patch of grass, PCE Slide past the monster kid trigger and exit the next room. If you wish to wrong warp out of this room, ensure that you do it on the first attempt, because skipping the cutscene makes the room push you out if attempting to re-enter the room.
